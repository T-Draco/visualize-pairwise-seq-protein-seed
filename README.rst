visualize-pairwise-seq-protein-seed README
=====================
Protein "SEED" sequences are representative amino acid sequences of each protein from a family. Pairwise alignments can be used to analyze sequence similarities between different proteins within the same family.  Biopython was used. This tool VISUALIZES sequence alignments and finds a pairwise match score. 

This module utilizes biopython, specifically the biopython AlignIO package. This module is intended for the visualization of pairwise sequence alignments, and for finding the pairwise match score, of Pfam SEED alignments. This module was made for non-profit reasons. Improvement edits to this repository are highly encouraged with proper source code citations and use of the GitHub branch function. 

Please use the "pairwise_tool_ALL_seq.py" module with caution, as it utilizes a lot of processing power. 

The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.

The Biopython package is an open source software. Please see the "LICENSE.rst" file provided by: <https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/LICENSE.rst>`for further details.

Installation of biopython
========================

    pip install biopython 

Biopython requires numpy, which is installed automatically when biopython is installed with the pip function.
